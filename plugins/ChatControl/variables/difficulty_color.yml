# The type determines where the variable can be used:
#
# MESSAGE - players can use this variable in chat with [key] syntax (DOES NOT YET WORK, comes in CCP9)
# FORMAT - you can use this variable in your format with the {key} syntax 
#
Type: FORMAT
#
# The key we look for in the chat, example:
# chat message: "Hello everyone, I have an [item] in my hand"
#
Key: "difficulty_color"
#
# The value the key will be replaced to.
#
# This uses JavaScript and must return a boolean value
#
# If you have no idea how to code in JavaScript you most likely take
# no benefit of custom variables, but if you do, please see the following

Value: |-
  var world = player.getWorld();

  // This line returns the value.
  getColor() + world.getName() + "&8";

  // You can create methods inside the script, too.
  function getColor() {
      var diff = world.getDifficulty().getValue();

      var diffs = ["&a", "&2", "&6"];
      return diffs[diff] !== undefined ? diffs[diff] : "&c";
  }
